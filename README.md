VirtualPersistAPI
=================

VirtualPersistAPI (VPA) is a RESTful-ish http-base API for storing arbitrary data in a database.

What?
-----

You'll be able to store stuff in a database over the web.

Specifically, VPA is designed for use by scripting systems which, even though they can do sophisticated things with data, can't persist that data within the system, and can make http requests.

I'm talking about Second Life.

This is a mistake. Woot.

License
-------

The final licensing for this project will be an open-source license compatible with its components, and free for anyone to use however they see fit.

Roadmap
-------

Part of the reason VPA exists is that I needed a project for a PHP class, and this is an idea I've had for a while.

VPA will be written in Symfony2 and Doctrine, and thus in PHP.

It will be developed in the following manner:

- The RESTful API will be designed and specified.
- Tests will be written against the API specification.
- Entities and their relationships will be designed and specified.
- Tests will be written against the entity specification.
- Symfony and Doctrine will be written to make the tests pass.

That's the idea, anyway. Let's see how it goes.

Contribution
------------

If you're in the class and want to work on this project, please ping me let me know and we can do it.

If you're not in the class, I'll have to discuss it with my instructor, but I wager it's do-able.
